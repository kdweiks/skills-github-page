title: NEA Crystalline Rock Chemistry (CrysChem) Literature Database
description: The Crystalline Rock Chemistry (CrysChem) database, presented by the Crystalline Rock Club (CRC) of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA), is a comprehensive BibTeX reference file containing hydrogeochemical data and chemical process models relevant to nuclear waste repositories in crystalline rock. Designed for use with reference manager software, the database includes abstracts, tags for specific data, and excludes full papers, aiming to facilitate the organized and accessible exchange of information crucial for deep geologic repository science.
